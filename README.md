## Galaxy Properties Estimation with Machine Learning (COSMOS2020)

This repository is dedicated to the estimation of various properties of galaxies using machine learning models. Leveraging data from the COSMOS2020 catalogue, the project aims to provide insights into the characteristics of galaxies through advanced computational techniques.

## Getting Started

1. **Clone the Repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/IAstro_2023.git
2. **Explore Notebooks:** <br>
Dive into Jupyter Notebooks to understand the machine learning models and their application to galaxy properties estimation.

3. **Dataset and Documents:** <br>
Download the COSMOS2020 dataset here.
Refer to the PDF documents in the "Documents" folder for additional insights.

## Project Structure <br>
/Notebooks: Contains Jupyter Notebooks for machine learning models. <br>
/Datasets: Placeholder for the COSMOS2020 dataset. <br>
